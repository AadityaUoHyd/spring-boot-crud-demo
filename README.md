# spring-boot-crud-demo

Probably the 1st program, a new beginner may indulge in. A basic demo code to show how we perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with SpringBoot and
MySQL. Here basic MVC architecture has been followed with Controller, Service and springBootJPA Repository layers.

- A sample of CRUD operations,
- Exception handling, 
- JUnit with Mockito testing, 
- Actuator FeatureEndpoints,
- Consuming resources of URL through RestTemplate client, etc has been also implemented for 'Department' Entity.
